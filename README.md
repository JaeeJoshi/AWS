# ðŸš€ Spring Boot Application Deployment on AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux)

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Spring Boot application to an **AWS EC2 instance (Amazon Linux), using **WinSCP** and **PuTTY**.

Project Structure:
Sample/
â”œâ”€â”€ target/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ myapp.jar
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

AWS account with EC2 access
- EC2 Windows instance running (with Java installed)
- Spring Boot `.jar` file built (via `mvn clean package`)
- WinSCP (for file transfer)
- PuTTY (for SSH access)
- `.ppk` private key for EC2 login

  ðŸ“¤ Steps to Upload and Run
  1. Build Your Spring Boot App
  2. In the terminal - mvn clean install --> This will generate a jar file.
  3. Create an EC2 instance.
     -Amazon MAchine Engine: Amazon Linux
     -Create New key pain - '.ppk' and download it.
  5. Open Putty
     -Host name: Public DNS
     -Upload private key as authentication credentials.
     -Log in as "ec2-user"(Linux)
     -Install java - sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corritto

  7. Open WinSCP
     -HOst name: public DNS address
     -user_name: ec2-user
     -password: ppk key pair file.

  9. Run the file in puTTY console
     - java -jar "jar file name"

  10. Add Chrome browser traffic in security group
      - port: 8080

  11. Open Chrome and put the public DNS address including the port
      -Example: "ec2-51-21-194-60.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080"

  12. Clean Up
      To avoid AWS charges:
      - Terminate the EC2 instance
      - Delete unused security groups, key pairs, and S3 buckets (if any)
